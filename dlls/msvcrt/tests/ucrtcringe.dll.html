</p>
<p>Hacking in <em>Wine</em> involves reverse engineering of <em>Windows</em> components
and algorithms, and the rule is that we have to do it without looking
at the <em>Windows</em> code, or disassembly. Instead, we write tests,
checking the outputs and side effects of function call sequences, and
then write code that would do the same thing.</p>
<br>
<p>It is a bit tedious and a long process, but most of the time it isn’t
actually very hard… maybe not even very fun either. Most of the time,
it doesn’t really deserve writing a story about it. Sometimes, it gets
hard… and fun.</p>

<h1 id="transcendance">Transcendance</h1>
<p>There’s a set of maths functions, called transcendental functions,
which <em>transcend</em> algebra. They cannot be expressed as a finite
sequence of algebraic operations<code>⁽¹⁾</code>, and cannot be exactly computed.
Instead, what a computer can only achieve, is an approximated result.
Of course, it is always possible to run a longer sequence of operations
to achieve more precision in the result, but it will never be exact.</p>
<p>This includes a lot of very useful functions, such as trigonometric,
exponential, or logarithm, which are used almost everywhere in games.
They often end up being used to compute some aspect of the game state,
which, in multiplayer games, may be compared against other players
expected state.</p>
<p>Any difference in the states could mean there’s something weird going
on, that some network packets got lost or that someone’s cheating. The
games often then bail out and end the game session: It’s what happens
in <strong>Age of Empires</strong> or <strong>Mortal Kombat 11</strong>, causing spurious
disconnects when you try to start a multiplayer game in <em>Proton</em>.</p>
<p>Why are there any differences between the expected state and the other
players’? Because each player may be running the game with a different
<strong>C</strong> runtime, some are on <em>Windows</em>, some are now using <em>Proton</em>,
and <em>Wine</em>. Maybe some could be playing on a console.</p>
<p>As these functions can only be approximated, and as finding a good
approximation function is a complex task, almost every programming
language provides an implementation of them. The <strong>C</strong> language runtime
makes no exception here, and the <strong>C</strong> language standard even mandates
it. The <em>GNU</em> <code>glibc</code> library, <code>musl</code> libc, and <em>Windows</em> <code>msvcrt.dll</code>
or <code>ucrtbase.dll</code>, all provide them.</p>
<p>What the <strong>C</strong> language standard doesn’t mandate though, is how they
must be approximated, and we’ll see, there’s an infinite number of ways
to do so, all equally valid. And even if precision is nice to have, it
is also sometimes costly to get, so trade-offs can be made between
performance and precision.</p>
<p>Overall, and most of the time, the results returned from the evaluation
of a certain transcendental function have very little chance to match
the ones from another implementation. It could even happen with the
same runtime, if it decides to use a different code path after some CPU
feature has been detected (think SSE, FMA instructions etc…).</p>
<p>In our case, comparing almost any of the <em>Wine</em> maths functions with
<em>Windows</em> <code>ucrtbase.dll</code> maths functions will show differences. Not so
much, but enough to make games unhappy when a player uses <em>Wine</em> and
another uses <em>Windows</em>.</p>

operation, subtraction, division, and root extraction.</em></p>

<h1 id="approximation">Approximation</h1>
<p>Function approximation is a large topic, so I will only focus on the
most common approach for the functions we’re interested in, and I will
use <strong>arcsine</strong> function as an illustration, because it has some
properties that makes it easier.</p>
<p>The <strong>arcsine</strong> function looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/asin_1.png" alt="The arcsine function, defined for x ∈ [-1; 1]" data-image="cdgu5l0e3bqn">
</figure>
<h2 id="range-reduction">Range reduction</h2>
<p>The first step is about handling corner cases. This is straightforward,
the <strong>arcsine</strong> function is only defined over the [-1; 1] interval, so
anything outside of this range should return an error:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>if (x &lt; -1 || x &gt; 1) return math_error();</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we reduce the problem space to reduce the range of values where we
want to actually compute an approximation. This is most often achieved
by exploiting mathematical relations between functions.</p>
<p>For instance, with <strong>arcsine</strong>, you have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>arcsine(-x) == -arcsine(x)</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>arcsine(x) == pi / 2 - 2 * arcsine(sqrt((1 - x) / 2))</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which we can exploit to reduce the range of x values where we need to
approximate <strong>arcsine</strong> to [0; 0.5]:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>if (x &lt; 0) return -asinf(-x);</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>if (x &gt; 0.5) { float z = sqrtf((1 - x) / 2); return pi / 2 - 2 *   asinf(z); }</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is only one possible reduction. There’s many other
properties that can be exploited. For instance you also have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>arcsine(x) == pi / 2 - arccos(x)</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>arcsine(x) == arctan(x / sqrt(1 - x²))</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>arcsine(x) == arccos(sqrt(1 - x²)), with x &gt; 0</code></p></li>
<li><p>etc…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If for some reason you found a better approximation of <strong>arccos</strong>, or
<strong>arctan</strong> and you want to compute <strong>arcsine</strong> from it, it’s very much
possible.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re not even limited to mathematical properties, and we can
very well decide to split the value ranges into pieces, and find an
approximation for each of these sub-ranges.</p>
<p>After the range has been reduced or split enough, we will now focus on
computing the approximation. There’s plenty of ways, we could hardcode
value in static tables, if we don’t care about the size in memory. Most
of the time nowadays, polynomial approximation is used instead.</p>
<h2 id="polynomials">Polynomials</h2>
<p>The idea is that for a continuous function <code>f(x), x ∈ R</code> and given a
maximum error <code>ε</code>, you can always find:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>P(x) = p₀ + p₁x + p₂x² + ... + pₙxⁿ</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So that <code>∀ x ∈ R, |f(x) - P(x)| &lt;= ε</code>. The smaller the maximum error,
the higher degree <code>P(x)</code> will need to be.</p>
<p>Of course, there are an infinite number of such polynomials that can
work, and plenty of ways to find one. For instance <strong>Taylor</strong> expansion
is the most well known method, but some other classes of polynomials
such as <strong>Chebyshev</strong> series are also sometimes used.</p>
<p>The <strong>Taylor</strong> expansion series of <strong>arcsine</strong> is actually very simple,
and it can be expressed in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>arcsine(x) = x + x * P(x²)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll use that for an additional range reduction, and compute the
approximation of <code>(arcsine(x) - x) / x</code> using <code>P(x²)</code> instead:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/asin-core_1.png" alt="The core arcsine function, (arcsine(x) - x) / x, x ∈ [0; 0.5]" data-image="834saeqmsyow">
</figure>
<p>An inconvenience with simple polynomials is that they tend to diverge
quickly around their definition range bounds, and for a small <code>ε</code> value
we may need to use a very large polynomial degree <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>The higher <code>n</code> is, the more computation we’ll have to actually do, and
the errors will also not be spread evenly across the value range.</p>
<p>For instance, using the <strong>Taylor</strong> series as the polynomial expression,
and for instance with a degree 2, we get the polynomial <code>P(x) = 1/6·x + 3/40·x²</code>, and plotting it with <strong>arcsine</strong>, we can see it’s already
pretty close:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/asin-taylor_1.png" alt="Taylor approximation of the arcsine function and error measurement" data-image="jzwlwr2nzfom">
</figure>
<p>Good enough, right? Well, not very good if you look at the theoretical
error. We could improve that by using the <strong>Taylor</strong> series expansion
evaluated around <code>0.125</code>, instead of <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>We now get a <code>P(x) = 0.00011432060688831153 + 0.16400250467599248·x + 0.09510025970319425·x²</code> polynomial instead, with an improved error
profile:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/asin-taylor-0.125_1.png" alt="Taylor approximation centered on x = 0.125, and error measurement" data-image="pz386ogqq4oa">
</figure>
<p>It’s better, and the error is more consistent over the range, but
there’s a better way: Instead of a simple polynomial, we can use a
rational polynomial of the form <code>P(X) / Q(X)</code>, with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>P(x) = p₀ + p₁x + p₂x² + ... + pₙxⁿ</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Q(x) = q₀ + q₁x + q₂x² + ... + qₘxᵐ</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rational polynomial are strange beasts, they cannot be expressed as
simple polynomials but they share the same properties for function
approximation. Although they also tend to diverge near the limits, they
can have a better average error overall, for lower degrees <code>n</code> and
<code>m</code>.</p>
<p>There too, several methods to compute them are available. One is
the <strong>Padé</strong> approximant, or other algorithms such as <strong>Remez</strong>
algorithm or <strong>minimax</strong> rational approximation also exist.</p>
<p>Note that all the functions are usually continuous on the value range
and easily derivable, so we could very well use more brute force
methods such as least squares method, or any other optimization
algorithm too.</p>
<p>For <strong>arcsine</strong>, we can use <code>polyrat</code> to compute first degree
polynomials <code>P(x) = -5.233528614964622e-06 - 0.1764267746171257·x</code> and
<code>Q(x) = -1.0610258247966033 + 0.5041027241138349·x</code>, and immediately
get 10 times better approximation than our best <strong>Taylor</strong> expansion:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/asin-polyrat_1.png" alt="Rational approximation computed by polyrat, and error measurement" data-image="avmo98i2tjqb">
</figure>
<p>As you see, our maximum error is already around <code>ε = 1e-5</code> with single
degree polynomials. Using rational polynomials degrees <code>3</code> or <code>4</code>, we
can easily achieve something like <code>ε = 1e-12</code> or better. It’s really
just a matter of adding more computations.</p>
<p>The implementation we currently use in <em>Wine</em> uses a 4th degree <code>P(x)</code>
and a first degree <code>Q(x)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<p>So, after we’ve found good polynomials, it will all be about evaluating
them. We can do it the naïve way, in the same way they are expressed
above, and compute <code>P(x) = p₀ + p₁x + p₂x² + ... + pₙxⁿ</code> and <code>Q(x) = q₀ + q₁x + q₂x² + ... + qₘxᵐ</code>, but we would need to compute <code>x</code> powers
many times, and that may not be the most efficient.</p>
<p>Instead, polynomials can be expressed in multiple forms, some being more
efficient for computing than others. The one that’s used by many <strong>C</strong>
language implementations is the <strong>Horner</strong> form, where we factor <code>x</code>
for each increasing power:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>P(x) = p₀ + x·(p₁ + x·(p₂ + ... + x·pₙ)...)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There exist other canonical forms, like the <strong>continued fraction</strong> for
rational polynomial, but I don’t know if it can be used efficiently.</p>
<p>Computing the <strong>Horner</strong> form is easy, we start with the highest degree
coefficient, compute <code>x·pₙ</code>, add the next coefficient, multiply by <code>x</code>,
add the next, etc…</p>
<p>It is especially efficient on modern hardware because they have
specialized CPU instructions called <code>FMA</code> for <em>fused multiply-add</em>,
which perform a multiplication and an addition at the same time.</p>
<p>So, we now know how to approximate our <strong>arcsine</strong> function, we can even
do it with an arbitrary high precision, by increasing our polynomial
degrees. In theory, that would mean that we can get as good results as
the <em>Windows</em> <strong>arcsine</strong> implementation? Well, no.</p>
<p>Computation is where things start to get tricky, and where the theory
falls apart: computer can’t count, they make mistakes… <strong>all the
time</strong>…</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1 id="floating-point">Floating-point</h1>
<p>Computers can’t count. They can’t even represent most real numbers. Not
exactly at least.</p>
<p>You don’t believe so? Run <code>python -c 'print(1/10 + 2/10 - 3/10)'</code> and
see for yourself. Any child knowing about fraction and addition can
tell you the answer is <code>0</code>. But <strong>Python</strong> cannot, and it prints
<code>5.551115123125783e-17</code> instead.</p>
<p>It’s not a language issue, every programming language will struggle at
this unless it does some kind of rational computation.</p>
<p>What happens here is that computers are limited. They cannot represent
arbitrary numbers efficiently and they need to work with a certain set
of numbers, all based on powers of two. This is also the case for real
numbers, using negative powers of two to represent decimal numbers. Any
number which is not a power of two needs to be rounded to the best
matching one.</p>
<p>They are also size limited, and they are only able to keep track of a
similarly limited amount of information, either the information about
the number digits, or about the power of two. Any number which requires
either a larger, or smaller power of two, or which has too many digits
to be represented will be truncated.</p>
<p>Then, even if two numbers can be represented exactly, the result of an
operation on these numbers might not be, and will have to be rounded or
truncated too.</p>
<p>There’s a standard which defines these representations and limitations,
called IEEE 754 floating-point. It defines the format used to represent
the numbers in memory, as well as how these rounding and truncations
should be done, and how operations on other floating-point numbers need
to operate.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/Float-example.png" alt="IEEE 754 32bit floating point representation in computer memory" data-image="gmy689vqwvao"></p>
<p><em>(<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3357169">By Vectorization: Stannered, CC BY-SA 3.0</a>)</em></p>
<p>Every addition, or multiplication, that operates on floating point
number will follow that standard. And everything is done to prevent
these rounding and truncations from causing invalid results, but
1ULP<code>⁽²⁾</code> errors are common and usually considered harmless, especially
when it comes to transcendental maths approximations.</p>
<p><code>⁽²⁾</code> <em>Unit in the Last Place, the last bit in the IEEE floating-point
representation</em></p>
<p>Moreover, these are rounding errors and they are thus heavily dependent
on the values as well as on the order of the computed operations. So,
the polynomials degrees, their coefficients, and the form used to
compute them, all matter very much.</p>
<p>In the end, even with a very accurate theoretical approximation, if the
operations we’re doing aren’t rounded in the same way as how <em>Windows</em>
does it, there’s little chance we end up with the exact same value for
every possible floating point value.</p>
<p>So yes, it looks bad, can we do something about it?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>There’s actually only one good solution to this issue: games, or game
engines, should implement and embed their own maths approximations.</p>
<p>And now, you know how to build your own, it’s not so hard and there’s
even existing open-licensed reference implementations for some extra
easy.</p>
<p>Including the implementation within the game will ensure that - assuming
the hardware works the same, but most of the time it does - it would not
depend on the runtime anymore. Whether you run on <em>Windows</em> or <em>Wine</em>,
it will give you the exact same results.</p>
<p>Then, from <em>Wine</em> hacking perspective, it’s simply not fun. What if we
could do better?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1 id="fun">Fun?</h1>
<p>What if we could find clues about the sequence of operations that were
done by looking at the input and the results, taking into account the
error that it produces?</p>
<p>It really sounds like looking into the cosmic background noise to figure
what happens in the room next to you, but could that work?</p>
<h2 id="writing-tests">Writing tests</h2>
<p>First of all, we will want every comparison we do to be exact. We need
all the bits of the compared values to match. So in order to avoid any
trouble with floating-point and implicit rounding, we’re going to use a
programming trick to access both the floating-point value and its
representation, when we need to manipulate or compare it, as a 32bit
integer value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">union float_value
{
    INT i;
    UINT u;
    float f;
};</code></pre>
<p>As we have 32bit of information, it means that there is around 4 billion
possible values. In addition, IEEE 754 defines 4 rounding modes that
can be enabled globally, and which will apply to every floating-point
operation that is done, possibly changing every result.</p>
<p>There’s <code>Round to nearest</code>, <code>Round toward 0</code>, <code>Round toward +∞</code>, and
<code>Round toward -∞</code>. We want <em>Wine</em> implementation to match <em>Windows</em>
implementation for all the values, regardless of the rounding mode in
use, but for now we’ll just assume the default <code>Round to nearest</code> is
used.</p>
<p>So, lets start by getting the easy cases out of the way. This includes
all the special floating-point values IEEE 754 defines, as well as
corner cases such as very small or out of range values.</p>
<p><em>NaN numbers</em>: these are not valid numbers. They are in the following
ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>[0x7f800001; 0x7fc00000)</code>: Signaling NaNs</p></li>
<li><p><code>[0x7fc00000; 0x80000000)</code>: Quiet NaNs</p></li>
<li><p><code>[0xff800001; 0xffc00000)</code>: Signaling NaNs</p></li>
<li><p><code>[0xffc00000; 0x00000000)</code>: Quiet NaNs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For all these, calling <strong>arcsine</strong> should return a <em>Quiet NaN</em> value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">static void test_asinf_nan( UINT min, UINT max )
{
    union float_value v, r;
    for (v.u = min; v.u != max; v.u++)
    {
        r.f = asinf( v.f );
        ok( r.u == (v.u | 0x400000), "asinf %#08x returned %#08x\n", v.u, r.u );
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><em>Domain errors</em>: these are invalid values for the <strong>arcsine</strong> functions,
they are in the following ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>[0x3f800001; 0x7f800001)</code>: (1.f; +inf]</p></li>
<li><p><code>[0xbf800001; 0xff800001)</code>: (-1.f; -inf]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For all these, calling <strong>arcsine</strong> should return a <em>Quiet NaN</em> and set
an error (not tested):</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">static void test_asinf_edom( UINT min, UINT max )
{
    union float_value v, r;
    for (v.u = min; v.u != max; v.u++)
    {
        r.f = asinf( v.f );
        ok( r.u == 0xffc00000, "asinf %#08x returned %#08x\n", v.u, r.u );
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><em>Tiny values</em>: these are valid values but very small, and <strong>arcsine</strong>
should return the same value as input:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>[0x00000000; 0x38800000)</code>: [+0; +6.10352e-05)</p></li>
<li><p><code>[0x80000000; 0xb8800000)</code>: [-0; -6.10352e-05)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The returned value should be the same as the input because the result is
truncated. This is interesting to test because it is effectively a
range reduction.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">static void test_asinf_tiny( UINT min, UINT max )
{
    union float_value v, r;
    for (v.u = min; v.u != max; v.u++)
    {
        r.f = asinf( v.f );
        ok( r.u == v.u, "asinf %#08x returned %#08x\n", v.u, r.u );
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, two more easy values can be tested: <code>0x3f800000</code> (+1) and
<code>0xbf800000</code> (-1):</p>
<p>Tests actually show that <em>Wine</em> is wrong here: our approximation may
return truncated results, especially with non-default rounding modes,
where <em>Windows</em> always returns ±π/2. Easy to fix and two less values to
worry about.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">static void test_asinf_pio2( UINT min, UINT max )
{
    union float_value v, r;
    for (v.u = min; v.u != max; v.u++)
    {
        r.f = asinf( v.f );
        ok( r.u == ((r.u & 0x80000000) | 0x3fc90fdb) /* ±π/2 */, "asinf %#08x returned %#08x\n", v.u, r.u );
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now only the <code>[0x38800000; 0x3f800000)</code> and <code>[0xb8800000; 0xbf800000)</code>
ranges remain, we can add a few more tests to validate that we can
indeed use the <code>asin(-x) = -asin(x)</code> range reduction we talked about
previously:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">static void test_asinf_sign( UINT min, UINT max )
{
    union float_value v, o, r;
    for (v.u = o.u = min; v.u != max; v.u++, o.u = v.u)
    {
        r.f = asinf( v.f );
        o.u ^= 0x80000000;
        o.f = asinf( o.f );
        o.u ^= 0x80000000;
        ok( r.u == o.u, "asinf %#08x returned %#08x\n", v.u, r.u );
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><code>00d4:math: -503316375 tests executed (0 marked as todo, 0 failures), 0 skipped.</code></p>
<p>These tests results look… alright? Good, so now it’s reduced down to
the <code>[0x38800000; 0x3f800000)</code> range. Only about 112 million values to
match.</p>
<h2 id="checking-errors">Checking errors</h2>
<p>We could try plotting <em>Wine</em> <strong>arcsine</strong> and <em>Windows</em> <strong>arcsine</strong> and
see if we can spot any pattern, but it’s actually pretty pointless:
they are very close to each other, they only mismatch for a few hundred
thousand values, and when they do, the mismatch is only about the last
bit of the value, not something that you will see.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to figure how much is 1ULP error, for every <code>x</code>. Note
that it’s not 1ULP relative to <code>x</code>, but relative to <strong>arcsine</strong>. We
keep these ULP stored as 64bit floats, because they are too tiny
otherwise:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Float:

    min_data = Float.from_repr(Float.repr(data) & 0x7f800000)
    ulp_data = Float.from_repr(Float.repr(min_data) + 1)
    return np.float64(ulp_data) - np.float64(min_data)

asin_ulp = utils.Float.ulp(np.arcsin(x))</code></pre>
<p>Then we load the 32bit values, and compute the differences using 64bit
floating-point which should be able represent tiny values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = utils.Float.from_repr(range(xmin, xmax))
wine_asinf = np.fromfile(open(f'{dir}/asinf-{xmin:08x}-{xmax:08x}-wine.dat', 'rb'), dtype=np.float32)
msvc_asinf = np.fromfile(open(f'{dir}/asinf-{xmin:08x}-{xmax:08x}-msvc.dat', 'rb'), dtype=np.float32)

diff = np.float64(wine_asinf) - np.float64(msvc_asinf)</code></pre>
<p>We can now check that there’s indeed only a few differences, and ignore
values where the results match already:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">assert len(x[diff != 0]) &lt;= 320000</code></pre>
<p>An we plot the differences, relative to the ULP:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>As you can see, differences are really all ≤ ±1ULP. The color also
corresponds to the density of points, blue is the least dense, red the
most dense<code>⁽³⁾</code>. And as you can see, the density is not uniform, which
means that <em>Wine</em> implementation is definitely biased toward some
direction.</p>
<p><code>⁽³⁾</code> <em>note that the scale is not linear, and instead the colors bands
are equalized for improved visibility.</em></p>
<p>In any case comparing these doesn’t give us much information, so let’s
try something else. For instance, let’s compare <em>Wine</em> and <em>Windows</em>
implementation to a higher precision <strong>arcsine</strong>, and let’s see if we
can get something useful out of the error profile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">wine_diff = np.float64(wine_asinf) - np.arcsine(np.float64(x))
msvc_diff = np.float64(msvc_asinf) - np.arcsine(np.float64(x))</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>Hmm, that looks nice, what about for instance the <em>GNU</em> <code>glibc</code>
implementation?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">gnuc_asinf = np.arcsine(x)
gnuc_diff = np.float64(gnuc_asinf) - np.arcsine(np.float64(x))</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>Wow… wobbly!</p>
<p>Does this tell us anything? Well, I think there’s at least a few
interesting points to make here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Windows</em> implementation likely uses the same 0.5 domain split
as <em>Wine</em> does, as well as the <em>GNU</em> <code>glibc</code> and most other
implementations. It is very visible on the pictures, with a clear
different error pattern for x &gt; 0.5.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>GNU</em> <code>glibc</code> implementation leaks a lot of its polynomial error
pattern. Look at our theoretical rational polynomial error above, it’s
very similar! <em>Wine</em> and <em>Windows</em> do not show the same, at least
nothing obviously visible, so they maybe using higher polynomial
degrees, or something different.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wine</em> implementation is really close to <em>Windows</em> in term of
signature. More specifically in the right most part of the
pictures, <em>GNU</em> <code>glibc</code> shows a segment that does not appear on the
other two.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="finding-patterns">Finding patterns</h2>
<p>Let’s try one last thing. Let’s zoom in a bit, close to 0.5, and assume
we’re computing something like <code>asin(x) = x + x * P(x²)</code>. Can we
recognize the error signature of the last <code>+</code> operation?</p>
<p>To find out, we first compute <code>f(x) = asin(x) - x</code>, as if we were
infinitely precise (using 64bit floating-point should be enough), then
we truncate that back to 32bit and compute the <code>asinf(x) = f(x) + x</code>
using 32bit floating point operations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">asin_addx = np.arcsin(np.float64(x)) - np.float64(x)
asin_addx = np.float32(asin_addx) + x

diff = np.float64(asin_addx) - np.arcsin(np.float64(x))</code></pre>
<p>Zooming to the <em>Wine</em> implementation profile for reference, to make some
patterns more apparent:</p>

</figure>
<p>Then the <code>+ x</code> operation theoretical induced error:</p>

</figure>
<p>Can you see it?</p>
<p>Okay, let’s go one step further, what about <code>* x + x</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">asin_madd = (np.arcsin(np.float64(x)) - np.float64(x)) / np.float64(x)
asin_madd = np.float32(asin_madd) * x + x

diff = np.float64(asin_madd) - np.arcsin(np.float64(x))</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/asin-core-madd-error.png" alt="Differences between theoretical last * x + x operation and a higher precision arcsine output" data-image="twbisb2naq58">
</figure>
<p>There’s definitely something. And we can compare with <em>Windows</em>
signature too, it shows the same kind of patterns:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/website/htmlimages/asin-core-msvc-error.png" alt="Differences between Wine and a higher precision arcsine output" data-image="49rrp05yhcyx">
</figure>
<p>I believe that proves, at least, that the last <code>* x + x</code> operations are
done in both implementations, and that <em>Windows</em> uses the same range
reduction as described above. Also, because <em>Wine</em> signature is already
very similar, I think it is likely that it uses a rational polynomial
approximation.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Can we go even further? Can we keep going and reverse engineer the whole
thing one operation at a time? Well… I don’t know. The more nested the
operations are, the blurrier their error signature gets. At least, doing
it visually, like I did here is probably not really going to work.</p>
<p>I believe there’s some information hidden in the errors. There’s
actually some more obvious differences between <em>Wine</em> and <em>Windows</em>
signature when non-default IEEE 754 rounding modes are used. Can these
be exploited to better match the results? Maybe.</p>
<p>At least, even if my analysis didn’t really go anywhere, I still enjoyed
the pointless investigation. And we got nice looking pictures too.</p>
